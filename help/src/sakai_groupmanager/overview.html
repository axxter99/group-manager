  <h2>Group Manager: Overview</h2>
  <h3>What it does</h3>
  <p>There are three ways to manage groups: Group Manager, Adhoc Groups and Section Info.</p>
  <ul><li>The <strong>Group Manager</strong> tool allows you to create adhoc groups and manage their membership.</li>
  <li><strong>Adhoc Groups</strong> is a feature in Site Info that offers similar functionality.</li>
  <li><strong>Section Info</strong> is the appropriate tool for creating sections in a course site and managing enrollment.</li></ul>
  
  <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
  <p>Ad hoc groups are a useful way to manage the flow of information to subsets 
    of site participants. You can use them to target content (such as messages, 
    resources or forum topics) at a particular group.</p>
  <h3>Things to Consider</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Only site owners and participants with full administrator rights will have permission 
      to use this tool. The Group Manager link in the left menu will not be visible 
      to other site members. </li>
    <li>Unlike Section Info, site members cannot sign up for adhoc groups, nor 
      may they view or change which groups they are in. </li>

    <li>You may create as many adhoc groups as you require and assign any number 
      of participants to each. Site members may belong to multiple adhoc groups.</li>
  </ul>
