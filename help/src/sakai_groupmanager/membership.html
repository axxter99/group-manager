    <li>Click <strong>Update</strong></li>

    from the group. If you wish to undo your change, click on the green arrow 
    to reinstate that individual's membership.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Replacing members</h3>

<h3>Viewing group membership</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Click on the group name</li>
  <li>In the block on the right hand side you will see the total number of group 
    members and a list of names. Where groups have a large number of members, 
    it may be useful to filter the list so that you can see a smaller selection 
    (e.g. if you type 'B' into the filter, only names beginning with 'B' will 
    be displayed).</li>
